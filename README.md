# Arcade Game

## Description

A Frogger-style arcade game built for Udacity's Front-End [Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/courses/web-development). Udacity provided the visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I added a number of ingredients including the characters (player and enemies) and their functionality.

## How to Play

- Open Index.html in your browser
- Use your arrow keys to move the player left, right, up and down. 
- Your goal is to move toward the water, evading the enemies who move on the paved block portion of the scene.
- If you collide with an enemy, the game is reset and you're moved back to the start square.
- If you reach the water without colliding with a bug, you win!
